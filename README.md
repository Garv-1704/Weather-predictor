Weather Prediction System
Dataset
The dataset contains historical weather data including attributes like temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, etc., recorded at different time intervals. The objective of the analysis is to predict future weather conditions based on past data, using machine learning or statistical models.

Tasks
1. Distribution of Weather Conditions
Examine the distribution of weather conditions in the dataset, such as sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc., to understand the frequency of different types of weather.

2. Relationship Between Variables and Weather Conditions
Investigate the relationship between independent variables (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.) and weather conditions. Determine which variables have a significant impact on predicting weather conditions.

3. Missing Values Detection
Check for missing values in the dataset for variables like temperature, humidity, precipitation, etc. Identify variables with missing data and propose strategies, such as imputation or removal, for handling missing values.

4. Visualization of Weather Attributes
Visualize the distribution of weather attributes like temperature, humidity, and precipitation using suitable plots such as histograms or boxplots. Analyze any noticeable patterns or trends in the data.

5. Weather Prediction Model
Build a weather prediction model using machine learning algorithms or time series forecasting techniques. Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics and validate its accuracy with test data.

6. Future Weather Forecast
Generate forecasts for future weather conditions based on the trained prediction model. Provide insights into potential weather patterns and variations expected in the coming days or weeks.
